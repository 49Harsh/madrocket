# Getting Started with Create React App




Project Overview:
This project is a comprehensive website for a school, designed to provide information and services to students, parents, faculty, and prospective students. The website is built using modern web technologies to ensure a responsive, interactive, and user-friendly experience.

Technologies Used:
- React.js: For building the user interface
- React Router: For handling navigation between different pages
- Redux: For state management (particularly for the admissions process)
- Tailwind CSS: For styling and responsive design
- Framer Motion: For smooth animations and transitions
- React Icons: For including visually appealing icons

Key Features:

1. Responsive Design:
   - The website is fully responsive, adapting to various screen sizes from mobile devices to desktop computers.

2. Interactive Navigation:
   - A header component with a responsive menu that collapses into a hamburger menu on smaller screens.

3. Home Page:
   - Welcoming introduction to the school
   - Carousel showcasing key highlights or events
   - Quick links to important sections

4. About Us Page:
   - Information about the school's history, vision, and mission
   - Message from the principal

5. Academics Page:
   - Overview of the curriculum offered
   - Details about various subjects and teaching methodologies

6. Admissions Page:
   - Information about the admission process and criteria
   - Online application form with form validation
   - Display of important dates and deadlines

7. Faculty Page:
   - Profiles of teaching and administrative staff
   - Contact information for faculty members

8. Students Page:
   - Information about student life and activities
   - Showcase of student achievements
   - Details about the student council and leadership opportunities

9. Gallery Page:
   - Photo gallery showcasing school events, activities, and infrastructure
   - Filtering functionality for different types of images

10. Contact Page:
    - School's contact information
    - Interactive contact form for inquiries
    - Google Maps integration showing the school's location

11. Footer:
    - Quick links to important pages
    - Social media links
    - Copyright information

12. Animations and Transitions:
    - Smooth page transitions using Framer Motion
    - Hover effects on interactive elements for better user feedback

13. State Management:
    - Use of Redux for managing application state, particularly for the admissions process

14. Accessibility:
    - Semantic HTML structure
    - ARIA attributes for better screen reader support

15. Performance Optimization:
    - Lazy loading of images and components to improve load times















This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
